# Dry climate extremes are worsening air quality
The pollution and meteorological measurements are averaged by hour (data are divided by year). The station nomenclature selected for the analysis is:
```bash
{
    "NORESTE": "NE",
    "NORESTE2": "NE2",
    "NORESTE3": "NE3",
    "NOROESTE": "NW",
    "NOROESTE2": "NW2",
    "SURESTE": "SE",
    "SURESTE2": "SE2",
    "SUROESTE": "SW",
    "SUROESTE2": "SW2",
}
```
